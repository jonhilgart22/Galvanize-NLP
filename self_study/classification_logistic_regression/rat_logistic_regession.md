1) The following statement is __false__. Change it to make it true.  
> Conditional models seek to maximize joint likelihood.

2) Which these model is easiest to parallelize across computers? Why?  
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Logistic regression  
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. Naive Bayes  
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. SVM  
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. Boosted Decision Trees  

3) Given the following features (PERSON and MOVIE) and class (Magic Mike), compute the score (= $∑λ_if_i$ (c,d)) for class Movie.
