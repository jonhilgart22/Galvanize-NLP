    Because hill is a hyponym of geological-formation, P(hill) > P(geological-formation). After taking the negative log of both probabilities, we see that IC(geological-formation) < IC(hill). Indeed, this intuitively makes sense, because saying that a thing is a hill provides more information than simply saying that something is a geological-formation.

  sim(c1, c2) =  2 log P(LCS(c1, c2)   2 log(.00176)                  -18.3
                -------------------- = -------------------------- = ----------      = 0.6259
                log P(c1) + log P(c2)  log(.0000189)+log(.000836)    -15.69+ -13.55

1) add 1 to each cell
2) get overall sum (40), sum for information (16), sum for data (10), and conditional (5)
3) log ((5/40)/(16/40)
