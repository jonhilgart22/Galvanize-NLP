__Subject__: Call for Data Engineering guest speaker on March 3

Hi!

My name is Dr. Brian Spiering, and I'm a faculty member at [Galvanize U](http://www.galvanizeu.com/) which offers a Masters of Science in Data Science. Currently, I'm teaching data engineering for Data Scientists. The course syllabus is attached below with a brief overview and the topics we cover. 

I would love to have a guest lecturer in my class on March 3. The class is very applied and the students would greatly benefit by hearing from someone who is currently working in data engineering and infrastructure. The class is 3-6pm. If that is a scheduling conflict, we could move the class to later that evening. It is located at 44 Tehama St San Francisco, CA 94105. As a bonus, I can take you to dinner in SOMA after.

Here are possible topics:

- Your journey in data engineering
- How you learned data engineering
- Things you wished you had learned earlier
- What you do now
- Stories from the "trenches"
- What does your team look like (role and responsibilities)
- How your company's infrastructure has evolved
- Current challenges (e.g., scaling, latency, or speed of ecosystem evolution)
- Deep dive into your favorite open-source project
- The future of data engineering

Ideally it would be 20-60 minutes. There is __no__ need for slides. Just telling stories and white-boarding would be lovely. The students are knowledgeable and curious so be prepared for extensive Q & A.

Any questions please send them my way. I look forward to chatting about this opportunity.

Best,
Dr. Brian Spiering

Description of the Course
---
Data Engineering will introduce you to working with distributed systems for efficiently collecting and analyzing large amounts of varied data. 

This is a survey-style course covering common data platforms and analysis patterns including Postgres (SQL), Hadoop (MapReduce), Spark, Kafka (logs), and Lambda Architecture (streaming).
